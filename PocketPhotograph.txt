I’ve only recently discovered this picture from a bundle of photos I was given, and this is one of the photos I treasure the most from that bundle.
It’s only from the timestamp in the photo that I know I was just two at the time.I don’t remember a single thing that happened at the time this picture was taken,
but I can imagine the joy and laughter from my family as they bundled me up in big, poofy winter clothing and compared my stature to the tall piles of snow. 

It’s bittersweet looking at this photo. I love seeing the smiling faces and I think it’s adorable how the two of us in the picture have matching attire;
but I always end up with an aching feeling of grief and sadness. I was really close to her, she lived with me and helped raise me;
I thought I would be able to have more time with her. My wish to have more years gradually narrowed down to just a few more months, then to a few more weeks,
and then just another day at a time, before there wasn’t even a single second of time left I could ever hope to ask for. 

Honestly, I would prefer to tuck this picture away somewhere and keep it safe. I don’t want a single thing to touch it, ever,
because I want to preserve it for as long as I’m alive. Keeping this photo around, even when I know it’s not an original copy,  unnerves me. 
It feels like the moment I lose it, or it gets “ruined” or crumpled up, it’s like I tarnished this memory and the image of the person I cared so much for. 
I guess it’s indicative that I haven’t moved on, because everytime I’ve looked at this photo and had time to revisit my memories, I’m just grieving. 
But the gradual marring of the edges and the creases that come with time—maybe that’s what I actually need to see.
