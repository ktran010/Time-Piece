What is a good exposure?
* Clarity of image, adequate brightness and shadows in image.
* Balance Dynamic Range (DR)
   * High Dynamic Range (HDR): image that have multiple images layered over it
* Adjusting the Exposure Triangle:
   * ISO: Adjusting brightness of photograph
      * DOWNSIDE: graininess, noise
   * Aperture: how much of lens is exposed, how open is the lens
      * The larger the denominator, the smaller the hole
         * EX: f/32 < f/1.4.
         * f/32 has a lens, small hole
      * Measured in f-stops (full stops)
      * Smaller aperture lens, smaller depth of field (everything from camera to foreground is sharp, anything else is out of focus)
      * DOWNSIDE: depth of focus
   * Shutter Speed: how fast the shutter closes. 
      * DOWNSIDE: blur



   * White Balance AKA Color Temperature:
   * Choosing a certain color temperature so that camera knows what’s supposed to be white light in certain settings
   * Flashes can be used to fill in shadows



      * Color Space
      * Use Adobe RGB for larger range of colors to capture photos with
