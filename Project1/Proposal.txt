I think the concept I want to portray/work with for this project is "what's forgotten".
It makes me think of blinking TV's left on late throughout the night, water overflowing a sink,
the stove left on (will not be attempting to photograph that for obvious reasons).

During the period of time someone forgets about a task they have to do or forgets about
a task that they left unattended for too long, a lot of things can happen. There is no control;
there's only speculation, doubt, and worry. It's a lot like how someone can see a drastic "before" and "after"
set of images and can only speculate about everything that happened in between those moments.

Like how a long exposure can capture movement as trails of light, I want to try to capture
the movement and changes that occur in a period of forgetfullness. I imagine that I would
utilize long exposure photography to capture the flow of water for example, and I'm interested
in trying to take a picture of my bedroom every single day (alike the man taking a photo of himself
everyday for 20 years). I think it would be interesting to see how the end of my day looks every day,
see all the things that are representative of chores/tasks I've forgotten to take care of.
